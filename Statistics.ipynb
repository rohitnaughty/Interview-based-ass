    "Q-1. A university wants to understand the relationship between the SAT scores of its applicants and their college GPA. They collect data on 500 students, including their SAT scores (out of 1600) and their college GPA (on a 4.0 scale). They find that the correlation coefficient between SAT scores and college GPA is 0.7. What does this correlation coefficient indicate about the relationship between SAT scores and college GPA?"

    "Ans: A correlation coefficient of 0.7 indicates a strong positive relationship between SAT scores and college GPA. The correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 represents a perfect positive relationship, 0 represents no relationship, and -1 represents a perfect negative relationship. In this case, the correlation coefficient of 0.7 suggests a strong positive association, indicating that higher SAT scores are generally associated with higher college GPAs.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that correlation does not imply causation. While the correlation coefficient indicates a relationship between SAT scores and college GPA, it does not establish a cause-and-effect relationship. Other factors, such as study habits, motivation, and personal circumstances, can also influence college GPA and should be considered when interpreting the results."

    "Ans: a. To determine the percentage of individuals in the dataset with heights between 160 cm and 180 cm, we can use the properties of the normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the mean height is 170 cm and the standard deviation is 10 cm, we can calculate the z-scores for both heights using the formula: z = (x - μ) / σ, where x is the height, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For 160 cm: z1 = (160 - 170) / 10 = -1\n",
    "\n",
    "For 180 cm: z2 = (180 - 170) / 10 = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a standard normal distribution table or a statistical software, we can find the area under the curve between z = -1 and z = 1, which represents the percentage of individuals with heights between 160 cm and 180 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The area between z = -1 and z = 1 is approximately 0.6826 or 68.26%. Therefore, approximately 68.26% of individuals in the dataset have heights between 160 cm and 180 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. To calculate the probability that the average height of a randomly selected group of 100 individuals is greater than 175 cm, we can use the Central Limit Theorem. The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution with a mean equal to the population mean and a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard deviation of the sample means is calculated as σ / sqrt(n), where σ is the population standard deviation and n is the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the population standard deviation is 10 cm, and the sample size is 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard deviation of the sample means = 10 / sqrt(100) = 10 / 10 = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can calculate the z-score for a height of 175 cm using the formula: z = (x - μ) / σ, where x is the height, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "z = (175 - 170) / 1 = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a standard normal distribution table or a statistical software, we can find the area to the right of z = 5, which represents the probability that the average height is greater than 175 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The area to the right of z = 5 is very close to 0. Therefore, the probability that the average height of a randomly selected group of 100 individuals is greater than 175 cm is nearly 0.\n",
    "c. To calculate the z-score corresponding to a height of 185 cm, we can use the formula: z = (x - μ) / σ, where x is the height, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "z = (185 - 170) / 10 = 15 / 10 = 1.5\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the z-score corresponding to a height of 185 cm is 1.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. To find the approximate height corresponding to the threshold where 5% of the dataset has heights below that value, we need to find the z-score that corresponds to the 5th percentile.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a standard normal distribution table or a statistical software, we can find the z-score that corresponds to the 5th percentile. In this case, the z-score is approximately -1.645.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can calculate the height corresponding to this z-score using the formula: x = μ + z * σ, where x is the height, μ is the mean, z is the z-score, and σ is the standard deviation.\n",

    "Q-12. A pharmaceutical company develops a new drug and wants to compare its effectiveness against a standard drug for treating a particular condition. They conduct a study with two groups: Group A receives the new drug, and Group B receives the standard drug. The company measures the improvement in a specific symptom for both groups after a 4-week treatment period. a. The company collects data from 30 patients in each group and calculates the mean improvement score and the standard deviation of improvement for each group. The mean improvement score for Group A is 2.5 with a standard deviation of 0.8, while the mean improvement score for Group B is 2.2 with a standard deviation of 0.6. Conduct a t-test to determine if there is a significant difference in the mean improvement scores between the two groups. Use a significance level of 0.05. b. Based on the t-test results, state whether the null hypothesis should be rejected or not. Provide a conclusion in the context of the study."
